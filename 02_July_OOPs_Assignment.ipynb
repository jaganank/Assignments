    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It is a fundamental concept in OOP that promotes code reuse and establishes relationships between classes.Inheritance is defined as a mechanism where the sub or child class inherits the properties and characteristics of the super class or other derived classes. It also supports additional features of extracting properties from the child class and using it into other derived classes.\n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance in Object Orientated Programming (OOP) is to give the user ability to change the behavior of the libraries, without actually changing already working and debugged code.Changing other people's code always has a risk of introducing bugs because you may not fully understanding how the code works. In OOP, the user inherits the object and implements the behavior changes or new features with his own code, separate from the original code.This way if there are bugs, the user needs to debug and fix only his own code, which is of course an easier task."

    "Single Inheritance - When a subclass inherits properties from one base class, it is called single inheritance. In single inheritance , there is only one base class and one derived class. Multiple Inheritance - When a subclass inherits properties from multiple base classes, it is known as multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance can be referred to as the most basic inheritance of all types of inheritance in python. As the name suggests in this we derive a single base class from the single parent class or the existing class. The child class will take or inherit all the attributes of the parent class. It can also add its own methods and attributes or override the methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a new class is derived from two or more existing classes.\n",
    "We can say that there is a single-child class and there are two or more parent classes. The new class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent classes. The child class can access all the attributes and methods of both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single inheritance requires a small run time as compared to multiple inheritance due to less overhead. While multiple inheritance requires more run time as compared to single inheritance due to more overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "Modular Codebase: Increases modularity, i.e., breaking down the codebase into modules, making it easier to understand. Here, each class we define becomes a separate module that can be inherited separately by one or many classes.\n",
    "Code Reusability: the child class copies all the attributes and methods of the parent class into its class and use. It saves time and coding effort by not rewriting them, thus following modularity paradigms.\n",
    "Less Development and Maintenance Costs: changes must be made in the base class, and all derived classes will automatically follow.\n",
    "Reusability – Inheritance allows obtaining new classes from existing classes without modification. This helps reusability of information in the child class and adds extra functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Decreases the Execution Speed: loading multiple classes because they are interdependent\n",
    "Tightly Coupled Classes: Even though parent classes can be executed independently, child classes can only be conducted by defining their parent classes."
